"""
Find prose that a mechanical rename walked through.

The earlier version of this check only looked at '...' and "..." literals. The damage the
collaborator found -- "Release CBC entry.findings for Juan Dela Cruz?" -- lived in a TEMPLATE
literal, so the scan reported clean while a technician was reading it on screen.

This version reads all three quote styles, and for template literals strips the ${...}
interpolations first: what is left is the part a human actually reads. `${refund.target.amount}`
is code and fine; "Refund refund.target.amount" would not be.
