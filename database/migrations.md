# Database Migration & Schema History

## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-12 (Ticket Release Gating + Online Payment Gateway)

### Changed
* `visit_tests.chk_visit_tests_status` widened to allow **`'Waiting for Release'`**: the state between `'Processing'` (released to a modality, exam not yet performed) and `'Completed'` (result released to the patient). Recording findings and releasing them are two distinct clinical events and now have two distinct states, both visible to the front desk.

### Added
* `payments.gateway_provider`, `payments.gateway_session_id`, `payments.gateway_payment_id` — links a payment row to an online GCash/Maya checkout session (PayMongo hosted checkout). NULL for counter payments. Plus `uq_payments_gateway_session` (UNIQUE) and `idx_payments_gateway_session`, which the webhook uses to resolve a session back to its pending payment.
* A gateway payment is inserted as `payment_status = 'Pending'` when the patient is redirected, and only flips to `'Paid'` when a signature-verified `checkout_session.payment.paid` webhook arrives. The browser's return to `success_url` is never trusted — it is a plain URL the patient can navigate to directly.

### Migration
* Applied additively by **`backend/src/scripts/migrateTicketFlow.js`** (idempotent, runs in a single transaction, safe to re-run) rather than by `migrateDb.js`, which is destructive and would discard accumulated seed/test data. Same approach as [1.4.0] and [1.5.0]. `schema.sql` remains canonical for fresh installs and already carries every change above.

```bash
cd backend && node src/scripts/migrateTicketFlow.js
```

### Behavioural consequence (no schema change, but load-bearing)
* `resultRepository.findPendingByCategory` now joins `patient_visits` and requires `pv.status = 'Processing'`. Previously it filtered on `visit_tests.status` alone and never looked at the parent visit, so a ticket appeared on a modality worklist the instant a client attached tests during online booking — before confirmation, before payment, and even for cancelled visits.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-10 (Module 18: Notification — normalization refinement)

### Changed
* Replaced the single `notifications(id, user_id, title, message, type, is_read, created_at)` table from [1.4.0] with two tables: `notification_events(id, title, message, type, created_at)` and `notification_reads(id, event_id → notification_events.id ON DELETE CASCADE, user_id → users.id ON DELETE CASCADE, is_read, UNIQUE(event_id, user_id))`, plus `idx_notification_reads_user (user_id, is_read)`.
* Reason: the original design inserted one full row (duplicating `title`/`message`/`type`/`created_at`) per broadcast recipient. That's not a formal normal-form violation (each row is fully determined by its own single-column key), but it duplicates event content N times per broadcast with no single place to correct it — a genuine event/read-state entity split. This shape separates the event (written once, immutable) from who has read it (per-user, mutable).
* No API contract change — `GET /notifications`/`PATCH /notifications/:id/read`/`PATCH /notifications/read-all` return the identical JSON shape as before (`notificationRepository.js` joins the two tables and aliases columns back to the original flat shape), so `notificationService.js`, the controller, routes, and the frontend needed zero changes. Applied additively/replacively on the live dev DB (old `notifications` table dropped — held only disposable test data from Module 18's own verification).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-10 (Module 18: Notification)

### Added
* `notifications(id, user_id → users.id ON DELETE CASCADE, title, message, type CHECK IN ('info','success','warning'), is_read, created_at)`, plus `idx_notifications_user_created (user_id, created_at DESC)`. Backs the real notification center behind `SidebarLayout.jsx`'s previously-static mock list. A broadcast-to-role event (e.g. "a new appointment was booked") fans out into one row per recipient user at insert time, rather than one shared row per event — each recipient gets an independent read state instead of racing to mark a shared row read.
* Applied additively (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`) directly against the live dev database rather than via a full `migrateDb.js` re-create, to avoid discarding the substantial accumulated seed/test data from Modules 1–17. `schema.sql` is still the canonical source of truth for fresh installs.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-08-10 (Module 1: Authentication — Password Reset)

### Added
* `password_reset_tokens(id, user_id → users.id ON DELETE CASCADE, token_hash UNIQUE, expires_at, used_at, created_at)` — supports the forgot-password/reset-password flow (`POST /api/auth/forgot-password`, `POST /api/auth/reset-password`). Only a SHA-256 hash of the emailed token is persisted. Tokens are single-use (`used_at`) and expire after 1 hour; a new request deletes any prior unused tokens for that user.
* This closes the "Forgot password?" dead-button gap and the Google-OAuth-only-account login gap documented in `.agents/MODULE_SCOPE.md`'s Known Gaps — a Google-created account can now obtain a real, usable password via reset.


This file tracks all structural changes, migrations, and updates made to the PostgreSQL schema.

## Canonical database initialization sequence

Run these three scripts from `backend/`, in this exact order, against a fresh database:

```bash
node src/scripts/migrateDb.js     # (re)creates all tables from database/schema.sql, incl. permissions/role_permissions — destructive, drops/recreates
node src/scripts/setupRbac.js     # seeds permissions + role_permissions data (requires the tables above to already exist)
node src/scripts/seedUsers.js     # seeds one demo user per role
```

There is no single combined command — this is a deliberate three-step sequence, not an oversight. `migrateDb.js` owns structure only; `setupRbac.js` and `seedUsers.js` own data.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed
* **RBAC schema/migration drift**: `permissions` and `role_permissions` were previously created ad hoc by `backend/src/scripts/setupRbac.js` (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`), entirely outside `schema.sql`/`migrateDb.js`, and undocumented here. Consequence: re-running `migrateDb.js` (`DROP TABLE roles CASCADE`) silently dropped `role_permissions`' foreign-key constraint to `roles` without recreating it (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is a no-op once the table exists), leaving stale `role_id` values with no enforced referential integrity.
* `permissions` and `role_permissions` are now created by `schema.sql` itself (in the "Roles and RBAC" section, right after `user_roles`), with proper `DROP TABLE ... CASCADE` entries at the top of the file alongside every other table. They are now dropped and recreated together with `roles` on every `migrateDb.js` run, so the FK relationship can never be left orphaned.
* `setupRbac.js` no longer creates these tables (removed its `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements) — it is now a pure data-seeding script with an explicit precondition that `migrateDb.js` has already been run. Its seed data (13 permissions, per-role mappings) is unchanged.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added
* Created `clinic_operating_hours` table (per-weekday open/close window, slot granularity, and per-slot capacity) to drive dynamic appointment availability.
* Seeded default operating hours: Mon-Fri 08:00-17:00, Sat 08:00-12:00 (30-minute slots), Sunday closed.
* Added `GET /api/appointments/availability?date=YYYY-MM-DD` endpoint (new `scheduleRepository`) returning bookable time slots for a given date, computed from `clinic_operating_hours` minus already-booked, non-cancelled `appointments` rows.

### Changed
* `appointmentService.createAppointment` now performs a transactional, capacity-aware conflict check (Postgres advisory lock + row count against `max_concurrent_bookings`) before inserting an appointment, rejecting out-of-hours or already-full slots with HTTP 409.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-05 (Baseline)

### Added
* Created baseline [schema.sql](file:///c:/Users/Steven/Desktop/Enlogada%20Clinic%20Management%20System/database/schema.sql).
* Configured core tables: `roles`, `users`, `user_roles`, `patient_types`, `patients`, `patient_visits`, `appointments`, `test_categories`, `tests`, `visit_tests`, `hmo_providers`, `hmo_requests`, `hmo_request_tests`, `test_results`, and `payments`.
* Seeded default static values for Roles, Patient Types, Test Categories, and initial HMO Providers.

### Changed from Initial Draft
* **Removed Pet support**: Excluded `is_pet`, `species`, and `breed` details from `patients` as the clinic has finalized that they only handle human patients.
* **Added `queue_number` column** to `patient_visits` to support front desk and cashier workflow.
* **Added `appointment_reference` column** to `appointments` to support QR code generation/lookup.
* **Added `receipt_number` column** to `payments` to track cashier receipt issuance.
* **Enforced Referential Integrity**: Added missing foreign keys for audit trail fields pointing back to `users(id)`:
  * `patient_visits(created_by)`
  * `payments(processed_by)`
  * `test_results(released_by)`
  * `user_roles(assigned_by)`
