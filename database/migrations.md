## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-05 (Baseline)

### Added
* Created baseline [schema.sql](file:///c:/Users/Steven/Desktop/Enlogada%20Clinic%20Management%20System/database/schema.sql).
* Configured core tables: `roles`, `users`, `user_roles`, `patient_types`, `patients`, `patient_visits`, `appointments`, `test_categories`, `tests`, `visit_tests`, `hmo_providers`, `hmo_requests`, `hmo_request_tests`, `test_results`, and `payments`.
* Seeded default static values for Roles, Patient Types, Test Categories, and initial HMO Providers.

### Changed from Initial Draft
* **Removed Pet support**: Excluded `is_pet`, `species`, and `breed` details from `patients` as the clinic has finalized that they only handle human patients.
* **Added `queue_number` column** to `patient_visits` to support front desk and cashier workflow.
* **Added `appointment_reference` column** to `appointments` to support QR code generation/lookup.
* **Added `receipt_number` column** to `payments` to track cashier receipt issuance.
* **Enforced Referential Integrity**: Added missing foreign keys for audit trail fields pointing back to `users(id)`:
  * `patient_visits(created_by)`
  * `payments(processed_by)`
  * `test_results(released_by)`
  * `user_roles(assigned_by)`
