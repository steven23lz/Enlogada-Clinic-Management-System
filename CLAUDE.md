# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Enlogada Clinic Management System — an enterprise diagnostic healthcare platform for human diagnostic services only (Ultrasound, Laboratory, Digital X-Ray, 2D Echo, ECG). Veterinary/pet functionality was fully removed; do not reintroduce it.

Stack: React 19 (Vite, Tailwind CSS v4) frontend + Node.js/Express 5 backend + PostgreSQL.

## Commands

```bash
# Backend (port 5000)
cd backend
npm run dev              # nodemon, auto-restart
npm start                # plain node

# Frontend (port 5173)
cd frontend
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint              # oxlint
npm run preview

# Database setup (run from backend/)
node src/scripts/migrateDb.js     # (re)creates all tables from database/schema.sql — destructive, drops/recreates
node src/scripts/setupRbac.js     # seeds permissions/roles for RBAC
node src/scripts/seedUsers.js     # seeds one test user per role (password: Password123!)
node src/scripts/testRbacEndpoints.js  # manual RBAC endpoint smoke test

# Additive migrations for an EXISTING database (migrateDb.js is destructive and cannot be used on
# a live one). Each is safe to re-run; run them in order on any database created before [1.13.0].
node src/scripts/migrateIndexes.js           # [1.11.0] foreign-key and lookup indexes
node src/scripts/migrateResultAttribution.js # [1.12.0] recorded_by vs released_by
node src/scripts/migrateDataIntegrity.js     # [1.13.0] daily_counters + queue/receipt/payment uniqueness

# Clear accumulated E2E/fixture traffic, keeping reference data and seeded accounts.
# Dry-run by default; --confirm actually deletes. Refuses to run under NODE_ENV=production.
node src/scripts/resetDemoData.js             # report only
node src/scripts/resetDemoData.js --confirm   # apply

# Seed 5 patients, one at each workflow stage (needs both servers running).
node src/scripts/seedDemoScenario.js

# Retention pass for notification history. Schedule this daily in any long-lived environment.
node src/scripts/pruneNotifications.js --dry-run
node src/scripts/pruneNotifications.js
```

**Before a demo:** `resetDemoData.js --confirm` then `seedDemoScenario.js`.

The suite now cleans up after itself — `playwright.config.js` wires a global setup/teardown that stamps the run start and then deletes everything the run created (throwaway `@enlogada-e2e.test` accounts, plus any visit, payment, notification or audit row created inside the window). Row counts are identical before and after a run, so a seeded demo dataset survives testing. Set `E2E_SKIP_PURGE=1` to keep the data when debugging a failure. Cleanup never fails the run; if it errors it says so and leaves the data behind.

The E2E suite creates a throwaway client, patient, visit and payment on every run and never cleans up, so the dev database drifts a long way from anything a clinic would recognise — left alone it reaches thousands of visits and a billing queue hundreds deep. That skews demos, makes paginated/aggregate screens behave unlike production, and slowly breaks tests that walk a list to find their own record.

The worst of it is `notification_reads`, which is a **fan-out** table: `notifyRoles` writes one row per recipient per event, so its size is events × staff, not events. Because the suite also created staff and elevated accounts that were never cleaned up (137 Cashiers, 89 Admins, 45 SuperAdmins had accumulated), both factors grew at once and the table reached 255,540 rows across 4,309 events in five days — average fan-out 60, peak 181, with 99.4% never read by anyone. After a reset the same fan-out is 3. Production will not see the runaway staff count, but it has no retention either: 20 staff × 200 events/day is ~1.5M rows a year, growing forever. Schedule `pruneNotifications.js` (default: read 30d, unread 90d) in any environment that runs longer than a demo.

There **is** an automated end-to-end suite: `frontend/tests/e2e/` holds 5 Playwright specs (45 tests, ~9s) run with `npm test` (or `npm run test:ui`) from `frontend/`. It assumes **both dev servers are already running** and hits the real database — see `frontend/tests/e2e/README.md`. There are no unit tests; the backend has no test script.

The suite is a deliberately small demo-and-regression net, not exhaustive coverage: smoke, security boundaries (`api-authorization.spec.js`, which also covers Admin-vs-SuperAdmin separation of duties and combined-role access), ticket-release gating, payments, and laboratory results. It was cut down from ~200 tests once the module-by-module build-out finished; the rest asserted UI copy that legitimately keeps changing. Prefer adding a focused spec over reviving deleted ones from git history.

Run it before and after any non-trivial change and compare the pass/fail counts — the specs assert RBAC boundaries and some UI copy, so intentional changes to those will legitimately turn specs red and the spec must be updated alongside the code. A run takes ~10 seconds.

Two notes learned the hard way. The dev rate limiter allows 20,000 requests per 15 minutes; running the suite many times back to back trips it, and the resulting 429s surface as scattered, unrelated-looking failures — restart the backend to reset the counter. And navigation/role changes need `multirole@enlogada.com` (see `TEST_ACCOUNTS.md`) to exercise properly: a single-role account cannot reveal the class of bug where the sidebar offers a screen the router refuses to open.

Env files: `backend/.env` and `frontend/.env`, based on the respective `.env.example`. Backend needs `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, SMTP settings (for result-release emails), and Google OAuth credentials. Frontend needs `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and the API base URL.

## Architecture

### Backend layering (strict separation — see `.agents/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`)

`routes/` → `controllers/` → `services/` → `repositories/` → PostgreSQL (via `src/config/database.js`).

- **Routes**: endpoint definitions only, no logic.
- **Controllers**: parse/validate request, call one service, shape the response. No business logic.
- **Services**: all business logic lives here.
- **Repositories**: all SQL lives here — never write raw queries in controllers or services.

This layering is enforced convention in this codebase (checked by the "Project Architect" role described in `.agents/AGENTS.md`); keep new features consistent with it rather than mixing concerns into controllers.

### Auth & RBAC

- JWT-based auth (`backend/src/middlewares/auth.js`): `verifyToken` decodes the bearer token into `req.user` (contains `roles` and `permissions` arrays baked in at login).
- `authorizeRoles(...roles)` middleware gates routes by role name (e.g. `'Admin'`, `'Receptionist'`).
- `authorizePermissions(...perms)` gates by fine-grained permission strings (e.g. `tests:manage`); **SuperAdmin and Admin bypass all permission checks**.
- Roles/permissions are DB-driven (`roles`, `permissions`, `user_roles` tables), seeded via `setupRbac.js`.
- Google OAuth: `POST /api/auth/google` verifies an ID token via `google-auth-library`, then logs in or auto-creates a Client user.
- Frontend session handling: `frontend/src/config/api.js` (Axios) fires a global `auth:unauthorized` window event on HTTP 401; `AuthContext.jsx` listens for it to clear user state without breaking SPA navigation — follow this pattern rather than throwing/catching 401s locally in components.

### Frontend routing model

There is no router library — `frontend/src/App.jsx` does manual, role-based conditional rendering based on `user.roles` from `AuthContext` plus local `currentTab`/`activeNav` state. When adding a new page/dashboard, wire it into the role-branching logic in `App.jsx` rather than introducing a routing library.

Role → primary console mapping:
- SuperAdmin/Admin → `AdminDashboard` (plus `ServicesCatalog` for the services-catalog nav item)
- Receptionist → `ReceptionistDashboard`
- Cashier → `CashierDashboard`
- Laboratory/Xray/Ultrasound Staff → shared `DiagnosticDashboard`, filtered by category
- Client → `ClientDashboard`

Public (unauthenticated) pages: `Home`, `ServicesPage` (dynamically fetches active tests from `GET /api/tests`, so admin price/service edits appear live), `Login`, `Register`.

### Database

Schema lives in `database/schema.sql` (source of truth, applied wholesale by `migrateDb.js`); human-readable change log in `database/migrations.md`.

**Transactions:** `db.withTransaction(fn)` in `src/config/database.js` makes every query issued underneath it — at any call depth, through any repository — run on one connection and commit as a unit. It uses `AsyncLocalStorage`, so repositories need no `client` argument and cannot accidentally write outside the transaction. Nested calls join the transaction already in progress. **Never call `db.pool.connect()` directly**: a self-managed client inside a `withTransaction` opens a second, independent transaction that commits on its own, and with a bounded pool it deadlocks once every connection is held by a transaction waiting for another connection. Any service method performing 2+ writes that must succeed together belongs in `withTransaction`; keep bcrypt hashing and outbound email/HTTP *outside* it so a pooled connection is not held during slow work.

**Numbers that must be unique** (queue tickets, receipt numbers) come from `daily_counters` via `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE … RETURNING`, never from `SELECT COUNT(*) + 1`. Counting rows is not a sequence: it races under concurrency, and it rewinds when a row is cancelled or refunded, reissuing a number already handed to a patient. Unique indexes back all three invariants. Core flow through the tables:

`users` → `patients` (1:1 via `user_id`) → `patient_visits` (a clinic visit/queue entry) → `visit_tests` (tests attached to a visit, priced via `price_at_time`) → `test_results` (findings/file per visit_test, released by staff) and `payments` (billed against a visit). `appointments` link to a `patient_visit`. `hmo_requests` link a visit to an `hmo_providers` approval flow. `tests` belong to a `test_categories` row (Laboratory/Xray/Ultrasound/2D Echo/ECG) and have an `is_active` flag that controls public visibility.

### UI conventions

- Design tokens: primary accent `#769046` (green), dark slate containers `#1e293b`/`#192534`, font 'Outfit'.
- `frontend/src/components/ui/` holds shadcn/radix-based primitives (button, dialog, select, table, tabs, etc.) — reuse these instead of hand-rolling new primitives.
- `SidebarLayout.jsx` is the shared shell for staff/admin consoles (dark sidebar + top bar); `DashboardLayout.jsx` / `PublicHeader.jsx` / `PublicFooter.jsx` are the public-page equivalents.

## Repo conventions

- Files: PascalCase for React components, camelCase for JS utilities/backend files, snake_case for DB identifiers.
- Keep files focused; split when they exceed roughly 300–500 lines.
- `.agents/AGENTS.md` and `.agents/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` define an internal "AI team" convention (Architect/Backend/Frontend/Database/Business-Analyst roles) used to keep contributions consistent — the layering and naming rules above are drawn from it.
- A version-control skill (`.agents/skills/version_control_agent/`) exists for timestamped checkpoint commits/rollback via PowerShell scripts; this explains the "Checkpoint (yyyymmdd-HHMMSS)" style commit messages seen in git history. Don't assume this workflow applies unless the user invokes it.
