# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Enlogada Clinic Management System — an enterprise diagnostic healthcare platform for human diagnostic services only (Ultrasound, Laboratory, Digital X-Ray, 2D Echo, ECG). Veterinary/pet functionality was fully removed; do not reintroduce it.

Stack: React 19 (Vite, Tailwind CSS v4) frontend + Node.js/Express 5 backend + PostgreSQL.

## Commands

```bash
# Backend (port 5000)
cd backend
npm run dev              # nodemon, auto-restart
npm start                # plain node

# Frontend (port 5173)
cd frontend
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint              # oxlint
npm run preview

# Database setup (run from backend/)
node src/scripts/migrateDb.js     # (re)creates all tables from database/schema.sql — destructive, drops/recreates
node src/scripts/setupRbac.js     # seeds permissions/roles for RBAC
node src/scripts/seedUsers.js     # seeds one test user per role (password: Password123!)
node src/scripts/testRbacEndpoints.js  # manual RBAC endpoint smoke test
```

There **is** an automated end-to-end suite: `frontend/tests/e2e/` holds ~24 Playwright specs (~190 tests) run with `npm test` (or `npm run test:ui`) from `frontend/`. It assumes **both dev servers are already running** and hits the real database — see `frontend/tests/e2e/README.md`. There are no unit tests; the backend has no test script.

Run it before and after any non-trivial change and compare the pass/fail counts — several specs assert exact UI copy, sidebar nav labels, and RBAC boundaries, so intentional changes to those will legitimately turn specs red and the spec must be updated alongside the code. A run takes ~1–2 minutes.

Env files: `backend/.env` and `frontend/.env`, based on the respective `.env.example`. Backend needs `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, SMTP settings (for result-release emails), and Google OAuth credentials. Frontend needs `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and the API base URL.

## Architecture

### Backend layering (strict separation — see `.agents/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`)

`routes/` → `controllers/` → `services/` → `repositories/` → PostgreSQL (via `src/config/database.js`).

- **Routes**: endpoint definitions only, no logic.
- **Controllers**: parse/validate request, call one service, shape the response. No business logic.
- **Services**: all business logic lives here.
- **Repositories**: all SQL lives here — never write raw queries in controllers or services.

This layering is enforced convention in this codebase (checked by the "Project Architect" role described in `.agents/AGENTS.md`); keep new features consistent with it rather than mixing concerns into controllers.

### Auth & RBAC

- JWT-based auth (`backend/src/middlewares/auth.js`): `verifyToken` decodes the bearer token into `req.user` (contains `roles` and `permissions` arrays baked in at login).
- `authorizeRoles(...roles)` middleware gates routes by role name (e.g. `'Admin'`, `'Receptionist'`).
- `authorizePermissions(...perms)` gates by fine-grained permission strings (e.g. `tests:manage`); **SuperAdmin and Admin bypass all permission checks**.
- Roles/permissions are DB-driven (`roles`, `permissions`, `user_roles` tables), seeded via `setupRbac.js`.
- Google OAuth: `POST /api/auth/google` verifies an ID token via `google-auth-library`, then logs in or auto-creates a Client user.
- Frontend session handling: `frontend/src/config/api.js` (Axios) fires a global `auth:unauthorized` window event on HTTP 401; `AuthContext.jsx` listens for it to clear user state without breaking SPA navigation — follow this pattern rather than throwing/catching 401s locally in components.

### Frontend routing model

There is no router library — `frontend/src/App.jsx` does manual, role-based conditional rendering based on `user.roles` from `AuthContext` plus local `currentTab`/`activeNav` state. When adding a new page/dashboard, wire it into the role-branching logic in `App.jsx` rather than introducing a routing library.

Role → primary console mapping:
- SuperAdmin/Admin → `AdminDashboard` (plus `ServicesCatalog` for the services-catalog nav item)
- Receptionist → `ReceptionistDashboard`
- Cashier → `CashierDashboard`
- Laboratory/Xray/Ultrasound Staff → shared `DiagnosticDashboard`, filtered by category
- Client → `ClientDashboard`

Public (unauthenticated) pages: `Home`, `ServicesPage` (dynamically fetches active tests from `GET /api/tests`, so admin price/service edits appear live), `Login`, `Register`.

### Database

Schema lives in `database/schema.sql` (source of truth, applied wholesale by `migrateDb.js`); human-readable change log in `database/migrations.md`. Core flow through the tables:

`users` → `patients` (1:1 via `user_id`) → `patient_visits` (a clinic visit/queue entry) → `visit_tests` (tests attached to a visit, priced via `price_at_time`) → `test_results` (findings/file per visit_test, released by staff) and `payments` (billed against a visit). `appointments` link to a `patient_visit`. `hmo_requests` link a visit to an `hmo_providers` approval flow. `tests` belong to a `test_categories` row (Laboratory/Xray/Ultrasound/2D Echo/ECG) and have an `is_active` flag that controls public visibility.

### UI conventions

- Design tokens: primary accent `#769046` (green), dark slate containers `#1e293b`/`#192534`, font 'Outfit'.
- `frontend/src/components/ui/` holds shadcn/radix-based primitives (button, dialog, select, table, tabs, etc.) — reuse these instead of hand-rolling new primitives.
- `SidebarLayout.jsx` is the shared shell for staff/admin consoles (dark sidebar + top bar); `DashboardLayout.jsx` / `PublicHeader.jsx` / `PublicFooter.jsx` are the public-page equivalents.

## Repo conventions

- Files: PascalCase for React components, camelCase for JS utilities/backend files, snake_case for DB identifiers.
- Keep files focused; split when they exceed roughly 300–500 lines.
- `.agents/AGENTS.md` and `.agents/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` define an internal "AI team" convention (Architect/Backend/Frontend/Database/Business-Analyst roles) used to keep contributions consistent — the layering and naming rules above are drawn from it.
- A version-control skill (`.agents/skills/version_control_agent/`) exists for timestamped checkpoint commits/rollback via PowerShell scripts; this explains the "Checkpoint (yyyymmdd-HHMMSS)" style commit messages seen in git history. Don't assume this workflow applies unless the user invokes it.
