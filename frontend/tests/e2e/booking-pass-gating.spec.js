/**
 * The pass is a receipt, not a booking confirmation.
 *
 * The clinic takes payment before the visit [1.48.0], and every screen agreed about that except
 * the one the patient actually sees first: `BookingConfirmation` rendered the scannable QR the
 * instant a booking succeeded, with the words "present this code at the front desk" under it.
 * `AppointmentsTab` had the rule right the whole time (`showPass = isOpen && appt.is_paid`), and
 * `appointmentRepository.findByPatientUserId` documents it — so the app stated the rule in three
 * places and broke it in the one place a patient reads.
 *
 * The failure is not that reception would honour a QR for unpaid work. It is that the patient
 * stops: they have a pass, the screen tells them to present it, and nothing anywhere mentions
 * money. They arrive expecting to walk in.
 *
 * This drives the real wizard rather than asserting on props, because the bug was invisible to
 * every API test in the suite — the endpoint behaved correctly and always had.
