// Booking atomicity and duplicate handling.
//
// Online booking used to be three sequential HTTP calls — create the appointment, attach the
// tests, file the HMO claim — each committing on its own. A failure in the second or third left
// an appointment that existed while the patient was told the booking had failed. Because a
// non-cancelled appointment occupies its slot, and max_concurrent_bookings is seeded to 1, that
// phantom then refused the patient's own retry as "no longer available", steering them into
// booking a second, different slot. Two slots, one patient.
//
// POST /appointments now does all of it in one transaction, and recognises a repeat of a booking
// the same patient already holds instead of reporting a slot conflict. These tests lock in both
// halves; without them the failure is invisible until a receptionist notices a queue entry with
// nothing attached to it.
