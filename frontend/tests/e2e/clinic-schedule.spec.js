/**
 * The clinic's diary: its hours, its capacity, and closing one specific date. [1.57.0]
 *
 * `clinic_operating_hours` had been read by booking since the first release and written by nothing
 * — no route, no screen. So the clinic could not close for a holiday, could not shorten a day, and
 * could not say "one sonographer today, half the ultrasound slots". The booking grid went on
 * offering slots the clinic could not honour, and somebody telephoned every patient who took one.
 *
 * Four properties, and each has failed in a way worth naming:
 *
 *   A CLOSURE REACHES THE PATIENT   the whole point. An override the availability endpoint ignores
 *                                   is a setting that lies to the administrator who set it.
 *   CAPACITY 0 IS A REAL VALUE      `??` not `||`. With `||` a deliberate "open, taking no online
 *                                   bookings" silently falls back to the weekday's number.
 *   THE DATE IS THE DATE            a DATE column arrives as a JS Date at local midnight, and
 *                                   toISOString() then names the day before in PHT. Measured:
 *                                   closing 2026-11-24 reported "2026-11-23 is now closed".
 *   AN OVERRIDE IS NOT THE PATTERN  closing next Thursday must not close every Thursday.
