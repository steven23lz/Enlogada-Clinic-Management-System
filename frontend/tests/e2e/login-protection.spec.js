// Account lockout, and PHI read auditing.
//
// The lockout policy is deliberately forgiving, and that is the part worth pinning. A tight
// threshold turns the lockout into a denial of service against the clinic itself: anyone who can
// guess receptionist@enlogada.com could fail five logins at 08:00 and take the front desk offline
// during the morning rush, which is worse than the attack it prevents. So these assert both
// halves — that it eventually locks, and that it does NOT lock too early.
//
// The PHI audit tests pin the scope rather than the mechanism: reads of an identified patient are
// recorded, and the high-frequency screens (search, worklists) deliberately are not. Logging
// those would bury the entries an investigation needs under traffic that is just staff doing
// their job — the same fan-out mistake that took notification_reads to a quarter of a million rows.
