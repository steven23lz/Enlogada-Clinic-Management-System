// The two times a booking has, and the values a clinician must not miss. [1.63.0]
//
// Both of these are rules encoded in pure functions, and both are the kind of rule that is
// verified by a person squinting at a screen until somebody writes it down.
//
// ── Why the arrival time is worth a spec ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A booking used to carry one time. A patient reads "9:00 AM" as when to turn up, so they arrive
// at 9:00, queue at reception to check in, and their 9:00 slot starts late through nobody's fault.
// The clinic records a delay; the patient experiences being kept waiting for an appointment they
// were on time for.
//
// The fix is two NAMED times, and the naming is the load-bearing part — "9:00, arrive 8:45" reads
// as a correction, and a patient who believes the appointment is really 8:45 turns up at 8:30 next
// time. What this guards is that the lead time comes from ONE place: it appears on the booking
// confirmation, the portal list, the pass, the confirmation email and the day-before reminder, and
// the reminder previously hardcoded "about 10 minutes early" while nothing else mentioned arrival
// at all.
