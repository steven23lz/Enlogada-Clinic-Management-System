/**
 * Updating a service must not delete the fields the caller did not mention.
 *
 * `testRepository.updateTest` writes every column unconditionally. The Services Catalogue's
 * status toggle sent only categoryId, name, price and isActive — so every activate/deactivate
 * silently wiped that test's patient preparation.
 *
 * Reproduced on Fasting Blood Sugar before the fix: one toggle deleted "Nothing to eat or drink
 * except water for 8 hours". That sentence is not decoration — [1.25.0] puts it in the
 * day-before appointment reminder, so the patient is reminded of a fasting test with no
 * instruction to fast, eats breakfast, and the visit is wasted. Nobody would connect that back
 * to an admin having toggled a service off and on again a week earlier.
 *
 * `isActive` had the same shape from the other end: the controller defaulted an absent value to
 * `true`, so a PUT that did not mention it quietly re-activated a service someone had
 * deliberately taken off the public booking form.
 *
 * The distinction that makes a partial update safe is `undefined` (not sent — keep it) versus
 * `''`/`null` (sent — clear it), and the last test here is the one that stops the fix going too
 * far: an admin who empties the preparation box must still be able to empty it.
