/**
 * A booking joins today's queue when the patient checks in, not when it is made. [1.92.0]
 *
 * A booking used to join the queue on the day it was MADE and carry that day's ticket. Next week's
 * bookings sat in today's queue and at the till as "waiting", and a booking made last week never
 * reached the queue on its own day, so a patient who had booked ahead and came in unpaid could not
 * be found at the till. The desk's check-in is now the moment: the visit is stamped with it and
 * given today's next ticket. Until then a booking is a reservation, with a reference and no ticket.
 *
 * Pinned here: a new booking has no ticket and is in no queue (the staff list or the public
 * count); the check-in reply carries today's ticket; the visit is then in the queue with that
 * ticket, starting now; and checking it in a second time does not move it to the back of the line
 * with another number.
