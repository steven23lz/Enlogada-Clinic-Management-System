/**
 * The receipts a cashier issued, over a chosen range — state, fetching and paging as one thing.
 *
 * ── Why a hook and not a class ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This is the "object" the four dashboards were asking for. CashierDashboard held 38 separate
 * pieces of state in one component, in four groups that never touch each other — the queue, this
 * history, the refund, and the till. Read top to bottom, the file was 38 unrelated `useState`
 * lines and then, hundreds of lines later, the handlers that act on them.
 *
 * A hook is React's unit of encapsulation: state plus the behaviour that owns it, behind one
 * named interface, testable and reusable on its own. A class component cannot do this job — it
 * cannot call hooks at all, so `usePolling`, `useAuth` and `useOperationsReport` would have to be
 * rewritten or wrapped, and the dashboards would become the only classes in a codebase of forty
 * function components. The one class here (ErrorBoundary) exists because React offers no hook for
 * error boundaries, which is the exception that shows the rule.
 *
 * `enabled` is what makes the history lazy: the caller passes false until the tab is opened, and
 * the first load fires once and only once. That belonged in the component as a `historyLoaded`
 * boolean and an effect keyed on the view — a piece of bookkeeping the screen had to remember to
 * do, which is exactly the kind of thing that belongs behind an interface rather than in a page.
