/**
 * Writing a diagnostic report, and releasing it.
 *
 * Recording findings and releasing them are two distinct events, matching the two ticket states
 * the front desk sees: `record` parks the ticket in 'Waiting for Release', and only `release`
 * notifies the patient. They were once one action, so "Authorize & Release Result" recorded
 * findings and told nobody.
 *
 * The form is reached three ways, and each resets a different amount:
 *
 *   openFor(test)      a new report, or editing one still awaiting release
 *   openForEdit(test)  amending a report that has already gone out
 *   openRelease(test)  releasing straight from a table row, with no form at all
 *
 * That third one is why every opener resets `findings`. Releasing from a row skips the form
 * entirely, and `release` below saves whatever is in `findings` first — so leftover text from a
 * previous ticket's session would be written over THIS ticket's recorded result, silently,
 * moments before it is sent to the patient.
 *
 * @param {object} user  who is releasing, for the receipt-style attribution on the success panel
 * @param {(test: object) => void} onOpened    the form opened for a test — for loading context
 * @param {() => void} onRecorded              findings saved, ticket now awaiting release
 * @param {() => void} onReleased              report sent
 */
/**
 * Stored rows -> the form's shape.
 *
 * The API returns one row per recorded field; the form holds a map keyed by field code, because
 * that is what makes "did the client render this field?" answerable when it submits. A derived
 * row is carried in too, so the technician can see the weight the last save computed rather than
 * an empty box that looks like missing data.
 */
/**
 * The form's shape -> what the printed report renders.
 *
 * Only used for the certificate shown immediately after releasing, where the values are still in
 * hand and re-fetching them would be a round trip for numbers the screen already has. Every other
 * surface reads the stored rows, which are authoritative.
