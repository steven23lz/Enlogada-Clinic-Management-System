/**
 * Today's bookings that have not arrived yet: the front desk's "still to arrive". [1.75.0]
 *
 * The desk had no list of the day's appointments at all. Appointments is Admin's screen, and the
 * only way to find a booking at the desk was to be handed its reference. The API has served this
 * all along — `GET /appointments` with a date and a status, behind `appointments:read`, which the
 * front desk holds — so this is a read, not a new endpoint.
 *
 * 'Pending' is a booking nobody has checked in: confirming it at the desk sets 'Confirmed'. Sorted
 * soonest first here, because the endpoint sorts newest first for the Admin screen, which is the
 * wrong way round for a morning.
 *
 * A failure is reported, not turned into an empty list: "no bookings left to arrive" over a failed
 * request is a false statement about the clinic. [1.74.0]
