/**
 * The till: the patient being billed, what they owe, and taking the money.
 *
 * Everything here is about one ticket at a time — selecting it, discounting it, charging it.
 * The queue it was picked from, the day's transaction log and the receipt document are all
 * separate concerns with their own hooks; this one neither reads nor writes them.
 *
 * `onPaid` is how a completed sale leaves. The hook does not know that a receipt gets shown or
 * that a queue gets refreshed — it announces the sale and lets the screen decide, the same shape
 * `useRefund` uses. That is what keeps the reprint path from being able to reach `bill`.
 *
 * `isAlreadyPaid` is a question rather than the Set itself, for two reasons. The checkout only
 * ever needs the answer for one visit, and — less obviously — the queue that knows the answer is
 * declared *after* this hook, because it reads `selectedVisit` to decide whether to keep polling.
 * A value would be read during this call and blow up on the temporal dead zone; a function is not
 * evaluated until the cashier clicks something, by which point everything exists.
 *
 * @param {(visitId: number) => boolean} isAlreadyPaid  settled today, so it cannot be charged twice
 * @param {(sale: {payment: object, bill: object, tender: object}) => void} onPaid
