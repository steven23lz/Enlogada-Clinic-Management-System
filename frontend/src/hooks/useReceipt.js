/**
 * The receipt document: what it shows, and how it gets on screen.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from the checkout, even though a sale opens one. A receipt is reached
 * two ways that have nothing to do with each other — a payment that was just taken, and a
 * reprint of one taken hours ago from the history tab — and only the first involves the till at
 * all.
 *
 * Keeping them apart is not tidiness, it is the fix for a real bug preserved in this file's
 * history: reprinting used to write into `billDetails`, the state the *checkout panel* renders
 * from. Selecting a visit, reprinting an older receipt, then returning to the queue rendered the
 * checkout panel from a history row — one patient's name and totals beside another patient's
 * queue number, which is the state a wrong-amount charge comes from. It also wrote an object
 * with no `items` array into something that does `billDetails.items.map(...)` unguarded, so the
 * terminal threw and whited out.
 *
 * With the two split, the reprint path has no reference to the checkout's bill and cannot
 * corrupt it. The bug is not fixed here so much as made unrepresentable.
