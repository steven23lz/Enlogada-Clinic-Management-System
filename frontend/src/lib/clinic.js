/**
 * The clinic's own identity, in one place.
 *
 * These strings were previously only in PublicFooter.jsx, as markup. That was fine while a footer
 * was the only thing that needed them — it stopped being fine the moment a printed receipt did,
 * because a receipt with a different address from the website is a document nobody can rely on.
 *
 * ── Why this is fetched rather than compiled in ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It used to read `VITE_CLINIC_TIN` and friends from `import.meta.env`, which Vite inlines at
 * BUILD time. Setting the clinic's TIN therefore meant editing `frontend/.env` and running
 * `npm run build` — an operation a clinic administrator will never perform, which is exactly why
 * the field was still empty and the receipt still printing "not a BIR-registered Official
 * Receipt" long after the feature existed. A correct mechanism nobody can operate is not a
 * working mechanism.
 *
 * `GET /api/clinic` reads the same values from the backend's environment, so setting them is a
 * `backend/.env` edit and a restart — the same operation as changing the SMTP password.
 *
 * The build-time values below are kept as the fallback, so a frontend that cannot reach the API
 * (the login page on a cold start, a network blip) still renders the clinic's name and address
 * rather than blanks.
 *
 * ── The statutory fields stay blank unless configured ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `tin`, `businessPermit` and `accreditation` are NOT given plausible defaults, and that is the
 * whole point: a BIR-compliant official receipt must carry the issuer's real TIN, and a made-up
 * one on a document a patient files for reimbursement is worse than no number at all — it is a
 * false record. The receipt prints without them and says so, until someone who knows the real
 * values sets them.
