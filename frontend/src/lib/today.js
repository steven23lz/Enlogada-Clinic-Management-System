/**
 * The rules behind the Today screens. [1.77.0]
 *
 * Every member of staff now signs in to Today: what needs them now, each with a button that does
 * something about it, and how the day is going. Steven chose it on the decisions page ("A and B":
 * Today first in every sidebar, and the screen staff land on). Nothing here fetches. The page reads
 * the endpoints the work screens already read, and these turn the answers into what it shows —
 * pure and clock-injected, so the thresholds are unit-tested rather than trusted
 * (tests/unit/today.test.js).
 *
 * A need is a DESCRIPTOR, not a component: `{ id, tone, icon, title, detail, action }`. Its action
 * says where it goes (`go`, with an `intent` for the screen it opens) or what it runs (`run`), so
 * the rules are testable without rendering and the page decides how to act on them.
 *
 * One rule shapes all of them: a fact appears once per screen. A need is something waiting on THIS
 * person; a figure is how the day is going. The same count is never both.
