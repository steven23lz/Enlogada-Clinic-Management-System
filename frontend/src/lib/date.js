/**
 * Date helpers for the clinic's LOCAL day.

 * `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)`, which is the **UTC** date, not the local one. The
 * clinic runs in Philippine time (UTC+8), so between midnight and 08:00 every single day that
 * expression returns *yesterday*. The consequences are all silent and all wrong in the same
 * direction:
 *
 *   - the Admin overview's "Today's Revenue" shows yesterday's takings,
 *   - Visit History and Transaction History open on yesterday's range,
 *   - a receptionist arriving for an 08:00 shift can be looking at the previous day's numbers.
 *
 * Nothing errors, so it reads as a quiet morning rather than a bug. The backend has always been
 * consistent about this — Postgres CURRENT_DATE is the server's local date, and
 * appointmentService already had a local-date helper for exactly this reason — so the frontend
 * was also disagreeing with the very rows it was asking for.
 *
 * These build the string from local getters instead, which is what every caller meant.

/**
 * A clock time as a patient reads it. "09:30" -> "9:30 AM". [1.36.0]
 *
 * The clinic runs on a 12-hour clock, and every stored time is 24-hour: `scheduled_time` is a
 * Postgres TIME, the availability grid emits zero-padded "HH:MM", and the reschedule endpoint
 * validates that shape. So this is a DISPLAY function and nothing more — the value it is given is
 * never the value that is sent back. Formatting on the way out and leaving the wire format alone
 * is what keeps a booking round-tripping through an API that has not changed.
 *
 * Written out rather than routed through toLocaleTimeString, for two reasons. The stored value is
 * a bare "HH:MM" string with no date, and `new Date("09:30")` is Invalid Date — so a Date would
 * have to be fabricated around it first, which is where UTC-vs-local errors get in. And the locale
 * form is not pinned: `hour: 'numeric'` renders 24-hour on an en-GB browser, so the clinic's clock
 * would depend on a machine's regional settings rather than on the clinic.
 *
 * Accepts "HH:MM" and "HH:MM:SS" — Postgres returns seconds and several callers had been slicing
 * them off by hand, one of which had been missed and was showing "09:00:00" on the check-in panel.
 *
 * Midnight and noon are the cases hand-rolled versions get wrong: `12` is neither `0` nor `24`,
 * so `h % 12` alone renders both as "0:00". Both are covered by tests.
