// Preparing a photo of an HMO card for upload.

// Lifted out of ClientDashboard.jsx unchanged. A self-contained browser routine — no React, no
// component state — and the booking dialog that calls it is itself being extracted, so leaving
// this behind would split one concern across two files.

// A phone photo of an HMO card is 3-8MB and slow to send on clinic-grade mobile data, and the
// booking is refused without it — so a failed upload is a failed booking. Downscaling in the
// browser turns it into a few hundred KB.
//
// It also sidesteps iPhone HEIC: the canvas re-encodes to JPEG, so whatever Safari can decode
// arrives in a format the clinic's staff browsers can open. Where a browser CANNOT decode the
// source (Chrome and Firefox have no HEIC decoder), this rejects with a message that says so
// rather than uploading something nobody can read.
