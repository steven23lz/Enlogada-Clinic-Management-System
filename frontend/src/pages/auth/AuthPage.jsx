// The clinic's front door: sign in and create an account, in one page that owns the switch
// between them.
//
// ── Why the page changed shape, twice ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// [1.23.0] replaced a white form card floating between the public header and footer — four framed
// rectangles, none obviously the thing to do next — with a two-column layout and no footer.
//
// This pass fixes what that left behind:
//
//  * The dark column used `.rail-gradient`, which washes green AND azure over near-black. That is
//    right for a hero band under a page of white content. Filling half the screen with it made a
//    large muddy field where the two hues meet. `.auth-panel` is one hue — the logo's azure —
//    walked from mid to deep along a single diagonal. A single hue cannot go muddy.
//  * Switching between sign-in and register was a text link at the very bottom of the form, below
//    the Google button, and the swap was a generic fade. The two modes are peers and the choice
//    belongs at the TOP, so a segmented control states both, says which one you are on, and gives
//    the transition something to actually transition between.
//  * The panel carried a headline, three paragraphs and a full address block. It reads as a wall
//    beside a five-field form. Trimmed: the reassurance is what a first-time patient needs, and
//    the contact details are a quiet footnote rather than a fourth paragraph.
