/**
 * One receipt, on its own page, opened in its own tab. [1.52.0]
 *
 * ── Why a page and not another dialog ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The receipt document already existed and already printed correctly — but only as a dialog
 * inside the cashier's console, reachable only from the day's transaction list. A patient who
 * rings in October about a receipt from August could not be served: there was no address for one
 * receipt, so there was nothing to open, nothing to send, and nothing to keep open beside the
 * screen you were working in.
 *
 * `?receipt=RCT-…` is a real URL. It can be opened in a new tab, kept open in a second window
 * while the cashier carries on billing, bookmarked, or pasted to a colleague. It follows the
 * `?reset_token=` precedent already in App.jsx — this app has no router by design, and adding one
 * for a single deep link would be a large change to how every screen is reached.
 *
 * The token comes from localStorage, which is shared across tabs of the same origin, so a new tab
 * is already signed in. Nothing is put in the URL but the receipt number, which is deliberate: a
 * link carrying a credential ends up in browser history, in a chat message and in a screenshot.
 *
 * ── Not a PDF, not a picture of a receipt ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This renders the SAME `components/Receipt.jsx` the till prints at the counter, so a copy issued
 * months later is the same document rather than a reconstruction of one. It prints through the
 * browser at 80mm via the same `printing-receipt` body class the cashier's dialog uses. There is
 * no export step and no second rendering path that could drift from the original.
