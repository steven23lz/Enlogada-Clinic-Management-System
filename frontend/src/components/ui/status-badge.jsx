// Canonical status → meaning mapping for this app (see .agents/_shared/VISUAL_IDENTITY.md,
// "Status-to-color mapping" decision). Covers every distinct status/approval_status value
// across patient_visits, appointments, visit_tests, hmo_requests, hmo_request_tests, and
// payments (per database/schema.sql's CHECK constraints) so one component can represent all
// of them consistently, replacing the three independently hand-copied color maps found by
// the 2026-08-10 audit (ClientDashboard.getStatusColor, ReceptionistDashboard's inline
// ternary, DiagnosticDashboard's inline ternary).
//
// Statuses are grouped by what they MEAN rather than styled one by one. Twelve statuses across
// six tables collapse into six situations a member of staff can be in, which is what makes a
// queue scannable: you are reading the shape of the work, not memorising a dozen colours.
//
// Each group carries an icon as well as a colour. Colour alone fails anyone with a colour vision
// deficiency — roughly 1 in 12 men — and it also fails everyone else on a sunlit reception
// monitor, where amber-100 and emerald-100 are near-identical pale rectangles. The glyph is the
// part that survives both, so it is not decoration; it is the primary cue, with colour
// reinforcing it. The ring does similar work, giving each badge a defined edge instead of a
// tint that dissolves into the row behind it.
