// Placeholder shapes shown while data loads, in place of a line of centred grey text.
//
// Twenty-seven "Loading…" strings across the app all shared the same two problems. They occupy a
// single line where the real content will occupy many, so the page jumps the moment data lands —
// and a jump is the one thing guaranteed to make an interface feel unreliable, because anything
// the user was about to click moves out from under them. And a short string in the middle of a
// large empty panel reads as "nothing here" rather than "not yet"; on a slow connection people
// conclude the queue is empty and walk away from a screen that is about to fill.
//
// A skeleton answers both: it reserves the real height and it is unmistakably a loading state.
//
// Deliberately not animated with a sweeping shimmer. A pulse is enough to read as active, and on
// a queue screen that a receptionist keeps open all day a constant sweep in peripheral vision is
// an irritation rather than an affordance. `motion-reduce:animate-none` drops even the pulse for
// anyone who has asked the OS for less motion — vestibular triggers are a real accessibility
// concern, not a preference.
