/**
 * The section container, defined once.
 *
 * One card-chrome class string — a hairline border, a near-invisible shadow, a large radius and a
 * white fill — appeared verbatim (or near enough) forty-one times across the consoles, and the
 * copies that had drifted apart differed by a shadow step here and a border shade there. Those
 * were not decisions anyone made. Worse, the same treatment wrapped a KPI strip, a filter row and
 * a 200-row table alike, so nothing on a page announced itself as the primary content.
 *
 * A Panel is deliberately flat: a hairline border, no shadow, and its separation from the canvas
 * comes from the border plus the canvas being tinted rather than white. Shadow is reserved for
 * things that genuinely float (see `--shadow-float` / `--shadow-overlay` in index.css), so when
 * something does lift, it means something.
 *
 * `tone="sunken"` is for a panel nested inside another panel — a bill summary inside the POS,
 * say — where a second white box on white would vanish.
