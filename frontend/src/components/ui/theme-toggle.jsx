/**
 * One icon button, cycling Light → Dark → System. [1.39.0]
 *
 * This was a three-wide segmented control, and on the public header it read as a grey slab
 * floating beside the Create Account button. Two separate causes, both worth recording because
 * either alone would have been enough:
 *
 *   It was a SIBLING of the `hidden md:flex` nav cluster rather than a child of it, so at desktop
 *   width the header row had three flex items under `justify-between` — brand, nav, toggle — and
 *   the toggle was pinned to the far edge with a hole opening beside the CTA.
 *
 *   Its ground was `bg-slate-100 p-0.5`, which in this codebase is the SEGMENTED-CONTROL surface
 *   (SegmentedFilter, tabs.jsx, Navbar's Dashboard/Account switch all share it). Among a row of
 *   text links and one green button, that ground is what made it read as a slab.
 *
 * A single 36px bordered icon button is the header's existing idiom — both burgers and the
 * notification bell are exactly this shape — so it now sits in the row as another control rather
 * than as a panel someone dropped in.
 *
 * ── The cost of cycling, stated plainly ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A segmented control shows its options; a cycling one does not. Nothing else in this app cycles
 * through three states, so this is a new gesture, and that is a real trade rather than a free
 * win. It is paid for two ways: the glyph always shows the CURRENT state, and the accessible name
 * and tooltip both say what the NEXT press will do, so the control explains itself on hover and
 * to a screen reader without being clicked.
 *
 * `data-preference` is on the button so a test can assert the state it reached rather than
 * counting clicks — the cycle order is an implementation detail and a spec should not encode it.
 *
 * The accessible name deliberately contains neither "menu" nor "navigation":
 * mobile-patient.spec.js matches header buttons on /menu|navigation/i with `.first()`, so a
 * collision would silently pick this button instead of the burger.
