/**
 * `loading` puts the button in flight: a spinner appears, the button stops accepting clicks, and
 * assistive tech is told via `aria-busy`.
 *
 * It replaced a text swap that 43 buttons were each doing by hand — `{submitting ? 'Saving…' :
 * 'Save'}` — which had three problems. The copy had drifted ('Saving…' in six places, 'Saving…'
 * in four, and a ConfirmDialog that said 'Please wait...' on every destructive action in the app).
 * A static string gives no sign of life, so a slow request and a hung one look identical. And the
 * label growing mid-click reflows the row, moving whatever sits next to it out from under the
 * cursor at the exact moment somebody is clicking.
 *
 * The label is therefore kept, not swapped: "Take Payment" stays "Take Payment" and gains a
 * spinner. The width change is one icon rather than a whole word, and it never says less than it
 * did before the click.
