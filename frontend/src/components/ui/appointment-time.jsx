/**
 * "Scheduled 9:00 AM · Please arrive by 8:45 AM for check-in." [1.63.0]
 *
 * One component so the confirmation, the portal list and the booking pass cannot drift into
 * saying it three ways — which is what happened to the seventeen mono treatments `DataBadge`
 * replaced, and to the ETA before `EtaBadge`.
 *
 * ── Why the arrival time is SECOND but no longer quiet ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both halves of this matter, and they pull in opposite directions. Change one without reading
 * the other and you will undo a decision that was made on purpose.
 *
 * SECOND, and smaller than the appointment time. The appointment time is the fact; the arrival
 * time is the instruction. Leading with the instruction — "Arrive 8:45 (appointment 9:00)" —
 * makes patients treat 8:45 as the real time, and next time they arrive at 8:30 to be safe.
 * Order and size are what keep them two facts rather than one fact being corrected.
 *
 * BOLD and amber, though. [1.66.0] It used to be `text-micro text-ink-muted` trailing the
 * appointment on the same line — the smallest size and the weakest colour in the system — and
 * the clinic reported that patients were simply not seeing it. Their patients are mostly
 * middle-aged and not especially comfortable with software, and a muted 11px clause is not an
 * instruction to that reader; it is decoration.
 *
 * So the weight comes from colour, boldness and its own row, NOT from size or order. That is the
 * whole trick: unmissable without being promoted above the thing it qualifies. Amber because the
 * preparation callout on the same card already uses it and index.css redefines the ramp for dark
 * mode, so it is proven in both themes rather than invented here.
 *
 * The reason is stated too — "for check-in at the front desk" is why the earlier time exists. An
 * unexplained instruction to come early reads as the clinic padding its own schedule, and patients
 * discount it accordingly.
 *
 * It sits on its OWN line in the stacked variant. [1.68.0] It used to trail the time, so the label
 * "PLEASE ARRIVE BY" opened a sentence that the value line finished — one sentence across two type
 * treatments, ending in a hyphenated compound that read as a token rather than as English. Keep
 * label, value and reason on three lines; do not fold the reason back onto the time.
