 * top of each other read as two sections, so the controls looked unrelated to the list they
 * filtered.
 *
 * A Toolbar is lighter than a Panel on purpose: no fill, no shadow, and it sits in the same
 * visual layer as the canvas. It reads as chrome attached to the content below, which is what it
 * is. `attached` goes further and joins it to the panel beneath by squaring the bottom corners.
