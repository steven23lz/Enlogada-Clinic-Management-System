/**
 * The document the patient walks out with.
 *
 * ── What was wrong with the previous one ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It printed. That was about the extent of it. Three problems, in rising order of seriousness:
 *
 *  1. The action buttons sat INSIDE `.print-area`, so "Print Receipt" printed its own button.
 *     The print rule in index.css hides `body *` and reveals only `.print-area` and its
 *     descendants — put the toolbar in there and the toolbar comes out of the printer.
 *
 *  2. It carried no date, no time, no cashier, no visit reference, no clinic address, no contact
 *     details, and — for a cash sale — neither the amount tendered nor the change given. A
 *     receipt with no date is not a receipt; it is a note saying a number.
 *
 *  3. It reconciled its own arithmetic from `paymentSuccess.amount + discount + vat` but never
 *     showed the reader how, so a patient checking whether the senior discount was actually
 *     applied had to do the subtraction themselves.
 *
 * ── Deliberately not claiming to be a BIR Official Receipt ────────────────────────────────────
 * It says "Payment Receipt", and prints a line saying it is not a BIR-registered Official
 * Receipt, until the clinic is genuinely authorised to issue one. Fabricating a TIN or an OR
 * series to make the document look official would produce a false record that a patient might
 * file for reimbursement.
 *
 * The upgrade is keyed to the **permit** — the Authority to Print, or the Permit to Use for a
 * computerised system — and NOT to the TIN. That distinction is the whole point: a TIN identifies
 * the taxpayer, it does not authorise anyone to issue an official receipt, so a registered clinic
 * with no ATP/PTU still cannot. Keying it to the TIN, as this once did, would print "Official
 * Receipt" on a document that is not one.
 *
 * Set CLINIC_TIN and CLINIC_PERMIT in **backend/.env** (not the frontend — see lib/clinic.js for
 * why that moved), restart the backend, and the wording upgrades itself. Placeholder values are
 * detected and print a "sample configuration" band instead.
 *
 * ── Why 80mm ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Clinic counters print to thermal roll, not A4. The @page rule in index.css sizes the sheet to
 * 80mm so the output is not one narrow column stranded at the top-left of a portrait page.
