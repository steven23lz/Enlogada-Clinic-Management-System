            operational screen and it was spending it on something the reader already knew.

            What goes there instead is the one thing on this screen nobody could see: a released
            critical result still waiting on its phone call. The escalation used to depend on the
            technician who flagged it staying on the worklist — one raised near the end of a
            shift had nobody watching it. Clicking opens the list. [1.28.0]

            It stays visible at zero, deliberately: a counter that only appears when it is
            non-zero teaches people not to look for it, and "0 outstanding" is the reassurance
            the tile exists to give. Which is exactly why a failed check must never say it: it
            reads "Couldn't check" and opens the list with a Try again. [1.74.0] */}
