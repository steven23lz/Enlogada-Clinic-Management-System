  /**
   * The Google button is always shown when a client ID is configured. It is never hidden by us.
   *
   * There WAS a detector here that hid it when it looked dead, and it was wrong about what it
   * was measuring. It asked for `slot.querySelector('iframe')` and treated a missing or 0-height
   * iframe as proof the button had failed — but @react-oauth/google calls
   * `google.accounts.id.renderButton(container)` into a plain <div>, and GSI frequently renders
   * the pill as native DOM with no iframe at all. So on a perfectly working sign-in the query
   * returned null, the check read that as broken, and it hid a button the user had just used.
   * Reported twice from the real screen; not reproducible in a headless browser here, where the
   * origin is refused and the DOM looks different.
   *
   * Two attempts to make the heuristic smarter (a longer grace period, then letting it change
   * its mind in both directions) both missed this, because the premise was wrong rather than the
   * timing. A check that cannot distinguish "no iframe because it rendered natively" from "no
   * iframe because Google refused" is not measuring the thing it claims to measure.
   *
   * What it was guarding against is real: when the origin is refused, GSI still paints a
   * Google-looking pill and clicking it does nothing, because onError never fires — the flow
   * never starts. That is a genuine dead control. But hiding a WORKING button is the worse
   * failure of the two: it removes the sign-in method the user actually has, and it did so
   * repeatedly, where the dead-button case only appears while an origin allowlist propagates.
   *
   * If this needs solving properly it wants a real signal — Google publishing a failure state,
   * or intercepting the 403 on accounts.google.com/gsi/button — not geometry.

            console.cloud.google.com". That is a developer's instruction shown to a patient: it
            names an internal address, tells them to open a Google Cloud console they have no

            Sign-In was simply never configured, which is not an error at all — it is a

            Either way the patient's answer is the same and is already on screen: sign in with

            nothing about it. The diagnosis still exists for whoever needs it, in the console,
