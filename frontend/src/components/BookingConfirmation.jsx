/**
 * What the patient sees the moment a booking succeeds.
 *
 * ── The QR is a receipt, not a booking confirmation ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This screen used to render the scannable pass unconditionally, which quietly contradicted the
 * rule everywhere else in the app: `AppointmentsTab` issues the pass only when `is_paid`, and
 * `appointmentRepository.findByPatientUserId` documents why. A booking is NEVER paid at the
 * instant it is created — payment happens afterwards — so this screen was the one place that
 * handed out a pass for money the clinic had not received.
 *
 * The damage was not that reception would honour it. It is that the patient reasonably stops
 * here: they have a QR, the screen says "present this at the front desk", and nothing on it
 * mentions paying. They arrive expecting to walk in.
 *
 * So the pass appears only when there is nothing left to settle. Otherwise the reference is
 * printed as TEXT — the counter path never depended on the QR — and the screen says what is
 * owed and where to pay it.
