// The shared shell for every staff and admin console.
//
// ── What changed and why ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The rail had three structural problems that no amount of restyling would fix:
//
//  1. It could not scroll. The aside was `justify-between` with a fixed account block at the
//     bottom, so a SuperAdmin — who legitimately sees ten management destinations plus twelve
//     departmental ones — had the account button pushed off the bottom of a 768px-tall laptop
//     screen, with no way to reach it. The nav column now scrolls on its own and the brand and
//     account blocks are pinned.
//  2. Every group was permanently expanded, so that same SuperAdmin scanned twenty-two items to
//     find one. Groups collapse now, remembered per user in localStorage, and the group holding
//     the current screen always opens regardless of what was remembered — a collapsed state must
//     never hide where you actually are.
//  3. The "Acting as" notice was a full-width banner inside the content area, which pushed the
//     work down the page on every borrowed screen. It is a fact about the current screen, not a
//     message about the content, so it belongs in the header beside the title.
//
// The active-item treatment also changed, from a solid green pill to a brand-tinted row with an
// indicator bar down its leading edge. A solid fill of the primary colour is the strongest visual
// device the interface has, and spending it on "you are here" left nothing louder for the
// buttons that actually do something.
const GROUP_STATE_KEY = 'enlogada.nav.collapsedGroups';

const readCollapsedGroups = () => {
  try {
    const raw = localStorage.getItem(GROUP_STATE_KEY);
    return raw ? JSON.parse(raw) : [];
  } catch {
    // A corrupt or unavailable localStorage must not take the whole shell down with it.
    return [];
  }
};

  const userRoles = user?.roles || [];
  // Drives the permission half of nav visibility — see canSee in config/navigation.js. Refreshed
  // from the server by AuthContext, so a matrix change reaches the sidebar without a re-login.
  // Already the *effective* set: the role template plus this account's own grants, minus its
  // revokes, resolved server-side so the sidebar cannot disagree with the API.

  const userDepartments = user?.departments ?? null;

  // UI/UX Modernization Phase 7: ops destinations are deliberately shared — Admin/SuperAdmin see
  // every department's screens, not just their own (§3a intentional superset, not a bug). The
  // dense combined sidebar this produces was flagged as a clarity gap in the redesign audit: an
  // Admin viewing e.g. the Receptionist's Active Queue had no on-screen signal they were on a
  // screen "borrowed" from another role rather than an Admin-exclusive tool. Resolved below, not
  // by shrinking the sidebar (Admin genuinely needs full operational access), but by naming the
  // context once a borrowed screen is open.
  //
  // The items themselves now come from config/navigation.js, which App.jsx also routes from —
  // one record per destination carrying both its role gating and the console it opens, so the
  // sidebar can no longer advertise a screen the router will not open.
  const mainNavItems = visibleMainNavItems(userRoles, userPermissions, userDepartments);

  // Module 18 UI/UX Phase 1: every operational role previously had exactly one nav destination
  // (some even shared a "Dashboard" item that silently routed to the same page). Split into real,
  // focused destinations per role, grouped by department so Admin/SuperAdmin — who see all of
  // these at once — get a scannable sidebar instead of twelve undifferentiated items.
  //
  // visibleOpsGroups applies all three gates (structure, permission, department). The old code
  // re-filtered the result by role alone, which was redundant and, had the two ever disagreed,
  // would have been the looser of the two checks winning.
  const opsNavGroups = visibleOpsGroups(userRoles, userPermissions, userDepartments);

  // ones who could ever be on a borrowed screen. Since [1.20.0] a permission can put anyone on
  // any staff screen, so the check is now simply "do you hold the role this screen belongs to" —
  // which matters more, not less: whatever you do here is recorded under your name, and the

                Front Desk's "Visit History" from Diagnostics'.
