/**
 * The clinic's FAQ, on Home. [1.72.0]
 *
 * Every answer states something the system itself does, or already says somewhere else — nothing
 * here is a promise invented for a marketing page. Where a fact can change, it is read live: the
 * hours come from Clinic Schedule and the contact details from the clinic identity, so neither can
 * go stale on this page while being corrected everywhere else.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT claimed: the day-before reminder. sendAppointmentReminders.js only runs if the
 * clinic has scheduled it, and a page promising a reminder that never arrives is worse than one
 * that does not mention it.

          Either. Walk-ins are welcome during clinic hours and join the queue at the front desk. Booking
          online reserves a time for you and tells you exactly when to arrive.
        </p>

        <p className="m-0">
          Some tests do — fasting before certain blood tests, or a full bladder for some ultrasounds. The
          instruction is printed beside each test on the price list, and shown again when you book.
        </p>

      question: 'How will I get my results?',

        <p className="m-0">
          Released results are emailed to the address on your record. If you have an account, they are
          also saved in your patient portal, where you can view and print them at any time.

      answer: (
        <p className="m-0">
          Yes, we work with accredited HMO providers. Bring your HMO card to the front desk. If you book
          online with HMO, you will be asked for a photo of your card so the claim can be raised.
        </p>

        <p className="m-0">
          At the counter by cash, GCash or bank transfer. If you book online you can also pay into the
          clinic&apos;s own GCash or bank account and upload the proof; a cashier confirms it before your
          booking pass is issued.
