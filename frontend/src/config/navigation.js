// gating, while App.jsx owned an independent set of hardcoded id lists deciding what to render.
// They drifted, and the drift was a real defect rather than untidiness — the sidebar gated items
// with "does the user hold ANY of these roles", so a user holding both Receptionist and Cashier
// was correctly shown the Billing group, but App.jsx matched roles in a fixed order and returned
// the Receptionist console for every nav id. Clicking "Billing Queue" left them on the Front Desk
// screen, with the cashier features visible in the sidebar and unreachable in practice.
//
// Keeping the destination and its console in one record means a nav item cannot be offered
// without something being able to open it, and adding a screen is a single edit here.

// those records say something untrue about who did the work.
//
// That is now enforced by NOT granting Admin `results:write` / `billing:process` in the seeded
// matrix, rather than by a hardcoded role list here. The difference matters: a clinic that
// decides otherwise can tick the box, and one that does not, keeps the separation. The default
// is unchanged; only the ability to override it is new.

// Oversight/management destinations. Admin and SuperAdmin both reach these; the SuperAdmin-only
// console is separated out below rather than mixed in here.

// Every item here used to carry `roleRequired: ['Cashier', 'SuperAdmin']` and friends: a hardcoded
// list that a permission could not widen. That made the Role-Permission Matrix a liar. Ticking
// `billing:process` for Laboratory Staff saved, reported success, and did nothing — the nav item
// stayed hidden because the lab role was not in the list, and the API refused for the same reason.
// A matrix that cannot actually delegate is worse than no matrix, because someone reasonably
// believes they granted access and stops thinking about it.
//
// So the role list is gone. `staffOnly` is the only structural gate left, and `department` is the
// modality axis: a worklist needs both the permission AND cover for that room. A lab tech granted
// `billing:process` now really does get the Billing Queue — Billing names no department, so
// there is nothing else to satisfy — while a cashier granted `results:write` gets a worklist only
// for departments they have actually been assigned.

/**
 * Whether this user may see a destination. Three gates; all must pass.
 *
 * 1. STRUCTURE — `roleRequired` on the management items, `staffOnly` on the departmental ones.
 *    Not editable from any screen. This is the line a permission cannot cross: no tick in any
 *    matrix puts a patient on a worklist.
 *
 * 2. PERMISSION — the delegable layer, driven by the Role-Permission Matrix plus this account's
 *    own overrides. Both are already resolved into one list by the server before it reaches here
 *    (see userRepository's EFFECTIVE_PERMISSIONS), so the sidebar does not need to know whether a
 *    permission came from the role template or from an exception made for this one person.
 *
 * 3. DEPARTMENT — for a modality worklist only. `departments === null` means unrestricted, which
 *    is how Admin and SuperAdmin arrive here; `[]` means none, and the two must not be conflated.
 *
 * The same three facts gate the API routes behind these screens, so the sidebar cannot advertise
 * something the server will refuse — that equivalence is the whole reason the nav reads the
 * server's answer rather than deriving its own.
 *
 * SuperAdmin bypasses gates 2 and 3, matching authorizePermissions on the backend: somebody has
 * to be able to repair a matrix misconfigured into locking everyone out, and it is the role that
 * edits it.
