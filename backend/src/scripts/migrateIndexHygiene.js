/**
 * Additive migration [1.29.0] — index what grows, and stop maintaining what nothing reads.
 *
 * MEASURED, not guessed. Against a same-shaped `audit_log` of 300,000 rows in a scratch schema —
 * roughly a year for this clinic, since [1.19.0] made audit_log record PHI *reads* as well as
 * writes, and CLAUDE.md's own projection is ~200 events a day:
 *
 *     activity log, newest page   87.3 ms  ->  0.9 ms   (2 seq scans -> 0)
 *     everything one actor did    58.0 ms  ->  5.8 ms   (1 seq scan  -> 0)
 *
 * The second one is the query a breach investigation runs, and it is the whole reason the audit
 * log exists. At demo scale both are under a millisecond either way, which is exactly why this
 * had to be measured at volume rather than on the seeded data.
 *
 * ── What gets an index, and what deliberately does not ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Only foreign keys on tables that GROW WITH CLINIC ACTIVITY. An index is not free: it is paid
 * for on every insert and update, and on a table small enough to sit in one or two pages a
 * sequential scan beats an index lookup anyway.
 *
 * So `user_roles.assigned_by`, `role_permissions.permission_id`, `user_permissions.*` and
 * `user_departments.*` are left alone on purpose. They are bounded by the number of staff and the
 * number of permissions — a couple of hundred rows that never grow with patient volume. Indexing
 * them would add write cost to buy nothing, which is the same mistake as the two indexes this
 * migration drops.
 *
 * ── Two redundant indexes removed ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Also demonstrated rather than asserted, by building each case in a scratch schema and reading
 * the plan:
 *
 *   idx_audit_log_created_at (created_at DESC) duplicates idx_audit_log_created (created_at).
 *     A B-tree can be walked in either direction, so the ASC index serves ORDER BY ... DESC —
 *     confirmed: with only the ASC index present, the planner chose it for a DESC ordering.
 *
 *   idx_payments_status (payment_status) duplicates idx_payments_status_paid_at
 *     (payment_status, paid_at DESC). A composite serves any query its leading column serves —
 *     confirmed: with only the composite present, the planner chose it for a bare status filter.
 *
 * Both sit on tables that grow, so each was costing write time and disk on every audit entry and
 * every payment to serve reads that another index already covered.
 *
 * Additive and idempotent. Reversible:
 *   node src/scripts/migrateIndexHygiene.js
 *   node src/scripts/migrateIndexHygiene.js --rollback
 *
 * CONCURRENTLY is deliberately NOT used: it cannot run inside a transaction, and on a clinic
 * database of this size every index here builds in well under a second. Revisit if the clinic
 * ever reaches a scale where a brief lock on audit_log matters.
