/**
 * cleanE2eData.js — removes accumulated Playwright/e2e fixture data from a DEV database.
 *
 * Why this exists: the clinic schedule seeds `max_concurrent_bookings = 1` on 30-minute
 * slots (18 bookable slots per weekday). Every e2e run books real slots and never releases
 * them, so after ~3 days of runs every bookable day in the 14-day window was 100% full and
 * booking was impossible — for the test suite AND for anyone using the app. The suite was
 * effectively poisoning itself. Run this before/after a suite run to reset the fixture load.
 *
 * SAFETY:
 *   - Dry-run by default. Pass --apply to actually delete.
 *   - Runs in a single transaction; any error rolls the whole thing back.
 *   - Never touches non-e2e accounts. The keep-list is every user whose email is NOT
 *     @enlogada-e2e.test — i.e. the seeded @enlogada.com staff/client accounts and any
 *     real personal accounts.
 *   - Every FK in this schema is NO ACTION (no cascades), so deletion order is load-bearing;
 *     children are removed before parents below.
 *
 * Usage (from backend/):
 *   node src/scripts/cleanE2eData.js                      # dry run — counts only
 *   node src/scripts/cleanE2eData.js --apply              # perform the purge
 *   node src/scripts/cleanE2eData.js --apply --unlimited-slots   # also lift the dev slot cap
