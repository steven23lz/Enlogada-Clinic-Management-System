/**
 * Releases the test bookings that a stopped suite run left behind on a fixed test date. [1.72.0]
 *
 * booking-atomicity.spec.js books the SEEDED client on one far-off date. A run that finishes has
 * its bookings removed by the E2E purge, but a run stopped part-way never reaches its teardown, and
 * whatever it booked stays. The date has eighteen slots and the spec claims about eight per run, so
 * a stopped run or two later it cannot find a free one: "no slot left on 2026-11-18 that this run
 * has not used and this patient does not already hold". Measured on 2026-09-12: eleven leftovers,
 * six from a run on 2026-09-05 and five from one stopped that evening.
 *
 * Shelled out to from the frontend suite like e2eExpireHold.js, and for the reason
 * globalTeardown.js gives: the credentials and the `pg` client live here.
 *
 * Cancelled in the database, not through PUT /appointments/:id/cancel. The API sends the patient a
 * cancellation email — about 3 s a booking through Gmail, and eleven real emails to a test inbox —
 * which is right for a patient and wrong for test hygiene. The end state is the one the API
 * produces: appointment and visit both Cancelled, which frees the slot and takes the booking out of
 * the duplicate check.
 *
 * Guards, each independent, and each about what the script is allowed to touch:
 *
 *   - NODE_ENV must not be 'production'
 *   - the date must be in the FUTURE — a booking for today or earlier is a real visit
 *   - only bookings owned by the seeded test client or an @enlogada-e2e.test account
 *   - only a Pending booking whose visit has no payment of any kind, no result and no HMO claim
 *
 * Dry run unless --confirm, so it is also the one-command fix for that failure by hand:
 *
 *   node src/scripts/e2eReleaseTestDate.js --date=2026-11-18            list what would be released
 *   node src/scripts/e2eReleaseTestDate.js --date=2026-11-18 --confirm  release them
