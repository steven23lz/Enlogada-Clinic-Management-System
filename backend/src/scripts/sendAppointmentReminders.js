/**
 * Reminds patients about tomorrow's appointments. Schedule this daily. [1.25.0]
 *
 * `appointments.status` has carried 'No Show' since the beginning, which means the clinic was
 * already counting the problem and had nothing to do about it. A reminder the day before is the
 * standard tool, and the one that pays for itself: a no-show is a slot that earns nothing and
 * cannot be given to anybody else, because by the time you know, the day is gone.
 *
 * It also carries the preparation instructions, and that is the part worth the most. "Nothing to
 * eat or drink except water for 8 hours before your appointment" is actionable the evening
 * before; at the moment of booking, possibly three weeks earlier, it is forgotten by definition.
 * A patient who arrives having eaten is a wasted slot AND a wasted trip.
 *
 *   node src/scripts/sendAppointmentReminders.js              # tomorrow, dry run
 *   node src/scripts/sendAppointmentReminders.js --confirm    # actually send
 *   node src/scripts/sendAppointmentReminders.js --days=2 --confirm
 *
 * ── Safe to re-run, which is what makes it safe to schedule ───────────────────────────────────
 * Each appointment is stamped `reminder_sent_at` once it has been handled, and the query only
 * ever selects rows where that is NULL. Run it hourly and the second run finds nothing. A job
 * that cannot be run twice is one nobody dares automate, so it ends up run by hand — which is to
 * say not at all.
 *
 * The stamp is written even when there is no email address to send to. A walk-in registered at
 * the desk has no account; that is a permanent condition, not a transient failure, and leaving it
 * unstamped would make this job re-examine the same unreachable rows every night forever.
 *
 * ── Deliberately only 'Pending' ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A 'Confirmed' appointment is one the patient has already been checked in for, and Cancelled /
 * Completed / No Show are finished. Reminding any of them is worse than not reminding at all.
 *
 * Dates are handled in SQL rather than JavaScript, per the note in CLAUDE.md: CURRENT_DATE is the
 * server's local date, and building "tomorrow" from a JS Date would be the UTC day between
 * midnight and 08:00 in Philippine time — reminding the wrong day's patients, every morning.
