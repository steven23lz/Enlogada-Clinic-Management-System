    //   payment_status IN (…)     keeps 'Pending' and 'Failed' out. An online checkout inserts a
    //                             'Pending' row the moment the patient is redirected, and that is

    //                             (payment_status, paid_at) index, so the range below still scans.
    //
    //   receipt_number IS NOT NULL  is what separates the two meanings of 'Cancelled'. A patient
    //                             who opens a second checkout gets their first session cancelled

    //                             never appear here as a receipt. A *paid* receipt voided by staff
    //                             is a real reversal and must. The receipt number is the
    //                             difference: it is assigned on settlement and never before, so a
    //                             row that has one was, at some point, money.

    // for. Matching only paid_at left the summary's `reversed` figure with no row behind it on
    // the day it was reported.

   * followed by a separate INSERT of count+1, which produced duplicate official receipt numbers
   * two different ways:
   *
   *   - Concurrently: two cashiers settling in the same moment both read 5 and both mint
   *     RCT-YYYYMMDD-0006. Two patients leave holding the same receipt number, and the drawer can
   *     no longer be reconciled against the system.
   *   - With no concurrency at all: refunding a payment drops it out of the 'Paid' count, so the
   *     very next sale that day reuses a receipt number that has already been printed and handed
   *     to a patient.
   *
   * The counter fixes both. It counts issuances rather than surviving rows, so a refund cannot
   * rewind it, and ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE takes a row lock so concurrent callers serialise. A
   * unique index on receipt_number backs it at the schema level — see migrateDataIntegrity.js.
