 * queries, kept landing in req.user.roles, and kept being honoured by authorizeRoles, forever.
 *
 * That is the worst shape for an access control to have. A column that looks like it enforces
 * something and does not is more dangerous than no column at all, because whoever set the expiry
 * date reasonably believes access is bounded and stops thinking about it.
 *
 * This is also the one revocation path that the per-request authorization work did not already
 * cover: that change made role *removal* take effect immediately, while expiry-based revocation
 * still silently never fired.

/**
 * What an account may actually do, and whose data it may touch. [1.20.0]
 *
 * Three sources, resolved here rather than in the service layer, so that every path that loads a
 * user — login, /auth/me, the per-request authority lookup in middlewares/auth.js — gets the same
 * answer. A second resolution written somewhere else is a second answer waiting to disagree.
 *
 *   permissions = (union of the account's active role permissions)
 *                 + rows in user_permissions with effect='grant'
 *                 - rows in user_permissions with effect='revoke'
 *
 * Revoke wins over grant by construction: it is applied last, as a set difference. That is the
 * safe precedence — if the two ever disagree about the same permission (they cannot, the table is
 * unique on (user_id, permission_id), but if the constraint were ever dropped) the outcome is
 * less access rather than more.
 *
 *   departments  = the modalities implied by the account's roles
 *                 + rows in user_departments

 * versus patient — and nothing here can widen it.
