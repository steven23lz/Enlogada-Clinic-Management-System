  // UI/UX Modernization Phase 12: previously a caller-supplied approvalCode auto-approved the
  // request in this same call (status/approved_date set from the code's mere presence) — the
  // create step is Reception logging what the patient's HMO card/LOA shows, not an actual
  // verification, so a request always starts Pending regardless of whether a code was typed.
  // approval_code is still stored (Admin sees exactly what was submitted when reviewing), it just
  // no longer self-approves. Only hmoRepository.approveRequest (Admin/SuperAdmin-only route, see
  // hmoRoutes.js) can move a request to Approved. That matters more now that Clients can file
  // their own requests from the booking flow: a client states a claim, staff still grant it.
  //
  // The request and its linked tests are written together. Previously the parent row was
  // inserted first and each link appended in a loop from the service, so a failure partway
  // through left an orphaned hmo_requests row carrying a partial test set — visible to Admin on
  // the Service Requests screen as a claim covering fewer tests than the patient actually asked
  // for, which is a billing error rather than a cosmetic one.
  //
  // Atomicity is the caller's: hmoService wraps this in db.withTransaction, which joins the
  // booking transaction when there is one and opens its own when there is not. This method holds
  // no connection of its own, per the note in CLAUDE.md — a self-managed client inside an ambient
  // transaction is a second, independently-committing transaction, and with a bounded pool it
  // deadlocks once every connection is held by a transaction waiting for another connection.
