  // Feature Gap Plan Phase D: Reception's walk-in lookup previously showed name/type/demographics

  // a prior visit was invisible at check-in. unpaid_visit_count treats a visit as unpaid when it
  // isn't Cancelled and has no 'Paid' payment row, rather than reproducing getBillingSummary's
  // full per-test HMO-aware total here just to flag "does this patient owe anything."

   * Roster search, optionally confined to the caller's own departments. [1.21.0]

   * `departments` is `null` for anyone holding `patients:read_all_departments` — Reception, the
   * Cashier, Admin, SuperAdmin, or an individual granted it — and an array of category names for
   * everyone else. An array means: only patients who have actually had work in one of those
   * departments.
   *
   * Before this the search was unconditional, so any diagnostic account could type two letters
   * and page through the entire patient roster of a clinic they see one room of. The name match
   * was already the whole of the access control, and a name match is not an access control.
   *
   * The department predicate is an EXISTS rather than a JOIN so a patient with six lab tests
   * still comes back once; a JOIN here would multiply the row by their test count and the LIMIT
   * would then cut the result set at an arbitrary point mid-patient.

   * `query` is OPTIONAL now. It used to be required, so the screen opened on "search for a patient
   * to begin" and there was no way to simply look at the records — which is what somebody sitting
   * down to review them actually wants. With no query this returns the most recently seen
   * patients, which is the useful default: a clinic's live roster is the people who have been in.
   *
   * Paged at the SERVER. The old form had a bare LIMIT 20 with no offset and no total, so the 21st
   * match was unreachable by any means — for a clinic of any age that is most of the roster.
   *
   * ── The counts, and why they are subqueries ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Every aggregate is a correlated subquery rather than a JOIN, for the reason the original
   * comment gives and which still applies: a JOIN multiplies the patient row by their visit or
   * test count, and the LIMIT then cuts the page at an arbitrary point mid-patient. One row per
   * patient is the whole contract of this query.
   *
   * `archived_at IS NULL` unless asked otherwise. Archiving exists to take a record out of the
   * roster the front desk searches all day; a filter that ignored it would defeat the feature.
