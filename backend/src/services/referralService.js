/**
 * When a visit must name the doctor who requested the test. [1.23.0]
 *
 * One module because three places ask the question — reception registering a walk-in, a client
 * booking online with HMO coverage, and reception logging an HMO claim against a visit that
 * already exists — and three copies of a rule is how the desk ends up enforcing something the
 * booking form does not, or the reverse. Same reasoning as `isStaffUser` in constants/roles.js.
 *
 * ── The rule ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Required when the visit carries an HMO claim: the LOA process runs through the referring
 * physician, and a claim that cannot name one is difficult to reimburse. The clinic is left
 * chasing a doctor's details weeks later, against a patient who has long since gone home.
 *
 * Required for the 'Private' patient type, because at this clinic that type *means* "referred by
 * a private physician" — as opposed to a walk-in. A Private visit with no referring physician is
 * not a gap in the record, it is a record that contradicts itself.
 *
 * Not required for Self Pay. That leaves one case knowingly unenforced — a self-paying walk-in
 * can be given an X-ray with no requesting physician on file, and diagnostic radiography is
 * normally performed on a licensed physician's request regardless of who is paying. If the
 * clinic's licensing says otherwise, the fix is a `requires_referral` flag per test_categories
 * row rather than anything payer-shaped, because the requirement would then be about the
 * modality. Written down in migrations.md [1.23.0] so it stays a decision somebody can revisit.
