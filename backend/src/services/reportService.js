 * made, and nobody here has. They are starting values chosen to be plausible for a walk-in
 * diagnostic clinic — X-Ray fastest because the image is read on the spot, Laboratory slowest
 * because an analyser run has its own clock — and they are here so the chart has a reference line
 * at all, not because they are the right numbers.
 *
 * Overridable per environment (`TURNAROUND_TARGETS=Laboratory:90,Xray:30`) so the clinic can set
 * its real figures without a deployment. A table was the other option and would be the right one
 * once these are actually policy; building it now would dress three guesses up as a decision.
 *
 * A department missing from this map gets a NULL target, and the SQL then reports its turnaround
 * with no rate — measured, but not judged against a promise nobody made.
