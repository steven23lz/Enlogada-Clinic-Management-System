  /**
   * Breaks a visit's payable amount into VAT, discount and the balance due.
   *
   * The starting figure is the patient's own out-of-pocket amount — subtotal minus whatever the
   * HMO has actually approved — not the gross subtotal. A discount reduces what the *patient*
   * pays; applying it to amounts an insurer is settling would discount somebody else's money and
   * understate the receivable from the HMO.
   *
   * VAT, for a STATUTORY discount at a VAT-registered establishment:
   *
   *     VAT-inclusive price          1,000.00
   *     less 12% VAT                  -107.14    (price - price/1.12)
   *     ------------------------------------
   *     VAT-exempt sale                892.86
   *     less 20% discount             -178.57    (20% of the VAT-EXEMPT base, not of the price)
   *     ------------------------------------
   *     Amount due                     714.29
   *
   * The order is fixed by RA 9994 / RA 10754 and is not the intuitive one. A flat 20% off the
   * price gives 800.00, which overcharges the patient by 85.71 per 1,000 and understates the
   * deduction the clinic can claim; discounting first would also charge a VAT-exempt patient VAT
   * on part of the sale. `tests.price` is stored VAT-INCLUSIVE — it is the shelf price a patient
   * is quoted — so the VAT is extracted from it rather than added on top.
   *
   * Only statutory discounts are VAT-exempt. A promo or corporate rate is an ordinary discount on
   * a VAT-inclusive price, which is why `isStatutory` drives the branch and not the percentage.
   *
   * Each figure is rounded to centavos and the balance is derived from the rounded parts, so
   * `netDue + discountAmount + vatDeducted` always equals `gross` exactly. That matters because
   * processPayment rejects a submitted amount differing by more than a centavo — an arithmetic
   * disagreement here surfaces as a payment the cashier cannot complete.
   *
   * ── The rules themselves live in `./discount` [1.63.0] ──────────────────────────────────
   *
   * The whole calculation used to hang off one ternary here — `isStatutory &&
   * env.CLINIC_VAT_REGISTERED ? extractVat(gross) : 0` — which is the most consequential line of
   * arithmetic in the application and the least visible. It decides whether a senior citizen pays
   * ₱714.29 or ₱800.00 on a ₱1,000 service, and CLAUDE.md records that the clinic's registration
   * was believed to be the opposite of what it is for a full day.
   *
   * It is now four named strategies, each carrying the statute it implements, so the answer to
   * "why does a senior pay this?" is a class a panel can be pointed at. This method stays as the
   * service-layer entry point every caller already uses.
   *
   * Verified centavo-identical to the previous implementation across 16,320 field comparisons —
   * `node src/scripts/verifyDiscountParity.js`, which replays the old algorithm verbatim against
   * the new one over both VAT registration states.
   *
   * @param {object} params
   * @param {number|string} params.subtotal     Sum of `visit_tests.price_at_time`, VAT-inclusive.
   * @param {number|string} params.hmoCoverage  Approved HMO value, removed before discounting.
   * @param {number|string} params.percentage   Discount rate, 0-100.
   * @param {boolean} params.isStatutory        SC/PWD entitlement rather than a commercial rate.
   * @returns {{gross:number, vatDeducted:number, discountBase:number, discountAmount:number, netDue:number}}
