/**
 * Manual proof of payment: the patient pays into the clinic's own account and a cashier checks it.
 * See migrations.md [1.48.0].
 *
 * ── What this service is careful about ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The claimed amount is never trusted. On approval the cashier's existing `processPayment` runs,
 * which recomputes the bill server-side and refuses anything that does not match it — so a patient
 * typing ₱50 for a ₱1,450 visit cannot produce a ₱50 payment even if a cashier clicks approve.
 * The claim is a prompt for a human to look at a screenshot, not an instruction to the ledger.
 *
 * Approval also goes through the SAME path a counter payment takes, which is what earns it a real
 * receipt number from `daily_counters`, the visit release, and the cash-up entry. A parallel
 * "verified payment" writer would have been a second way to take money, and the two would have
 * drifted the first time either changed.
