   * Records that someone READ a patient's records.
   *
   * Every other call site in this service logs a write. Nothing recorded reads, so after the
   * mass-read hole that let any staff token walk the patient roster, the only trace would have
   * been a morgan line on stdout — which is not retained anywhere. A breach notification has to
   * name who accessed what, and that answer has to already exist when the question is asked.
   *
   * Scoped narrowly on purpose. This logs reads of an *identified patient's* records only: their
   * demographics, their result history, a specific result file. It deliberately does NOT log
   * worklists, queues or search results, which staff refresh constantly — that is the same
   * fan-out shape that took notification_reads to a quarter of a million rows, and it would bury
   * the entries that matter in noise. Reading a worklist is doing your job; opening one named
   * patient's file is the access an investigation actually asks about.
   *
   * Fire-and-forget like log() — a failure to record an access must not deny a clinician the
   * record they need to treat someone.
