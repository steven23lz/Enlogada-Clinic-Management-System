/**
 * What the patient receives about their own booking. [1.24.0]
 *
 * The system sent exactly two emails: a password reset, and a result release. Booking online
 * produced an in-app notification for *staff* and nothing at all for the patient — so the only
 * record of their appointment was a confirmation screen that vanished when they closed the tab,
 * taking the reference code the front desk asks for with it.
 *
 * That is the standard email a booking system sends, and its absence pushes work onto the clinic:
 * every patient who cannot find their reference becomes a phone call to reception.
 *
 * ── Preparation is the part that actually saves a visit ───────────────────────────────────────
 * A Fasting Blood Sugar needs eight hours without food; a pelvic ultrasound needs a full bladder.
 * A patient told neither arrives unable to be tested, and the slot is lost with them. The
 * instructions are included here because this is the message they will still have on the morning
 * of the appointment — the booking screen is not.
 *
 * ── Never throws, never blocks ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every function here is called AFTER the booking has committed, and sendEmail already swallows
 * SMTP failures. A clinic with no SMTP configured gets a logged skip and a working booking, which
 * is the correct trade: the appointment is the thing that matters, the email is a courtesy.
