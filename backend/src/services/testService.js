   * An omitted field keeps what the row already has. It does NOT reset it.

   * `testRepository.updateTest` writes every column unconditionally, so a caller that sends only
   * the fields it cares about silently destroys the ones it left out. The Services Catalogue's
   * status toggle did exactly that: it sent categoryId, name, price and isActive, and every
   * activate/deactivate wiped the test's patient preparation. Reproduced on Fasting Blood Sugar,
   * where it deleted "Nothing to eat or drink except water for 8 hours" — the sentence [1.25.0]
   * puts in the day-before reminder. The patient is then reminded of an appointment with no
   * fasting instruction, eats breakfast, and the visit is wasted.
   *
   * `isActive` had the same shape from the other direction: the controller defaulted an absent
   * value to `true`, so a PUT that omitted it would quietly re-activate a service someone had
   * deliberately taken off the public booking form.
   *
   * Distinguishing `undefined` (not sent) from `''`/`null` (sent, meaning clear it) is what makes
   * a partial update safe. Deciding it here rather than in the controller keeps it true for every
   * caller, including any future one that never reads this comment.

   * earlier tests attached and then threw. The receptionist sees an error and retries the whole
   * list, which now collides with uq_visit_tests_visit_test and surfaces as a bare 500. Nothing
   * in any endpoint tells them which of the tests actually landed, and getBillingSummary prices
   * strictly from visit_tests, so the patient is billed for a partial workup while the missing
   * test never reaches its modality.
   *
   * Validating every id up front means a bad id costs nothing: the batch rolls back and the retry
   * is clean.
   *
   * No transaction and no ownership check of its own — both belong to the caller, because the two
   * callers need different ones. `addTestsToVisit` below wraps it for Reception's walk-in flow;
   * `appointmentService.createAppointment` calls it inside the transaction that is also minting
   * the visit.
   *
   * It must NOT call assertClientOwnsVisit. Under the booking transaction that helper would be
   * reading a `patient_visits` row the transaction has not committed — which used to mean a
   * different pooled connection and a guaranteed 404, and even now that every query joins the
   * ambient transaction it is redundant: appointmentService asserts ownership on the patient
   * before it opens the transaction, and then mints the visit itself.
