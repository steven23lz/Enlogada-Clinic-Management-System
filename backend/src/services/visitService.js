   *   1. the visit has a 'Paid' payment (online via GCash/Maya, or recorded at the counter),
   *   2. staff have confirmed it: an Appointment must have been QR-scanned/checked in by a
   *      receptionist; a walk-in is confirmed by having been registered at the front desk.
   *
   * Whichever condition is satisfied last triggers the release, so both real-world routes
   * converge here:
   *
   *   Online   : book -> pay (GCash/Maya) -> receptionist scans QR  -> released
   *   Walk-in  : register at desk -> cashier confirms payment       -> released
   *

   * rather than throwing, because "not ready yet" is a normal outcome, not an error.

   * convenience feature's clothes.
   *
   * ── It reuses the same estimator the queue screens use ──────────────────────────────────
   *
   * Not a second calculation. A patient who reads "about 25 minutes" on the public page and is
