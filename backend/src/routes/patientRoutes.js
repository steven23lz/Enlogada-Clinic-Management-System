// Who may touch a patient record directly.
//
// ── History, because it explains the shape ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// These routes once carried verifyToken alone. The ownership check lives in the controller and
// reads `if (req.user.roles.includes('Client') && ...)`, so it was a no-op for every non-Client
// role — meaning any staff token, including the lowest-privilege diagnostic ones, could walk the
// integer id space with GET /api/patients/1,2,3… to dump the entire patient roster, and could PUT
// to rewrite another patient's name, birthdate and sex. Birthdate and sex are the fields
// diagnostic reference ranges key off, so that write was a clinical-safety issue, not merely a
// privacy one.
//
// The fix at the time was a role allow-list that excluded diagnostic staff outright. That was the
// right call *then*, because nothing confined what a diagnostic account could see once it was
// through the door — so the only safe answer was to keep it out. The cost was that a lab tech
// could read a result and had no way to look up the patient it belonged to.
//
// ── Why the allow-list is gone [1.21.0] ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Containment now exists, and it is finer than a role list could ever be. Two independent guards,
// both in the service layer where they cannot be bypassed by reaching the same data another way:
//
//   Client  — patientController re-checks `patient.user_id === req.user.userId`.
//   Staff   — patientService confines to the caller's own departments unless they hold
//             `patients:read_all_departments`. A record outside them 404s: a 403 would confirm
//             the record exists, and "does this clinic have a patient called X" is precisely the
//             question the scoping refuses.
//
// So the permission decides *whether*, and those two guards decide *whose* — which is what lets
// the allow-list go without widening anything. Keeping it would have meant a SuperAdmin granting
// `patients:read` to a diagnostic account, watching it save, and finding the route still refuses:
// the exact failure the [1.20.0] work existed to remove.
//
// Note `patients:update` is still not in the MODALITY grant, so diagnostic staff cannot rewrite
// demographics today. That is now a matrix decision rather than a hardcoded one, and it is
// enforced by the same department scope if it is ever granted.

// Archiving a record. [1.56.0] Admin and SuperAdmin only, by ROLE rather than by permission, and
// deliberately so: `patients:update` is held by Reception too, and correcting a misspelled surname
// is a different act from taking a record out of the roster the whole front desk searches.
//
// Nothing is deleted. The visits, bills and results stay exactly as they were — this only decides
// whether the record appears in the roster by default. Audited in patientService.setArchived.
