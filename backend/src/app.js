// 0. Baseline security response headers.
//
// This API serves patient-identifying records, so the defaults matter: nosniff, frameguard
// (an attacker's page cannot iframe an authenticated response), HSTS, and a referrer policy
// that stops URLs leaking to third parties. contentSecurityPolicy is off because this process
// only ever returns JSON and file downloads — the CSP that matters belongs to the Vite app,
// and a policy declared here would be both inert and misleading.
app.use(helmet({ contentSecurityPolicy: false }));

// 1. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
//
// Restricted to the configured frontend origin instead of the previous bare cors(), which
// reflected ANY origin. Because the browser sends the bearer token from JS rather than a
// cookie, a wide-open policy let any page a signed-in staff member visited call this API with
// their token and read the response. Extra origins can be listed in CORS_ORIGINS (comma
// separated) for staging or LAN testing.
const allowedOrigins = new Set(
  [env.FRONTEND_URL, ...(process.env.CORS_ORIGINS || '').split(',')]
    .map((o) => o.trim())
    .filter(Boolean)
);
app.use(cors({
  origin: (origin, cb) => {
    // No Origin header: same-origin, curl, health checks, and the PayMongo webhook. These are
    // not browser cross-origin requests, so CORS is not the control that applies to them.
    if (!origin || allowedOrigins.has(origin)) return cb(null, true);
    // Withhold the header rather than raising: an error here surfaces as a 500, which reads as
    // a server fault and tells the caller more than it should. Omitting the header is what
    // actually stops the browser handing the response to the calling page.
    return cb(null, false);
  },
  credentials: true
}));

// 2. Parse Incoming JSON and URL-encoded requests
//
// The `verify` hook stashes the raw request bytes on req.rawBody. The PayMongo payment webhook
// signs the exact bytes it sent, so verifying against a re-serialised req.body would fail on
// every legitimate delivery (key order and whitespace are not preserved by a parse/stringify
// round trip). Capturing here — rather than mounting the webhook route ahead of this parser —
// keeps route ordering, CORS, logging and rate limiting identical for every endpoint.
app.use(express.json({
  verify: (req, res, buf) => {
    req.rawBody = buf;
  }

  }
}));

// 4. Rate Limiting Middleware
// Production stays deliberately tight at 100/15min. The dev ceiling exists only so the
// frontend/tests/e2e Playwright suite can run: that suite is now ~190 tests, most of which
// perform several authenticated API calls, and it comfortably exceeded the previous 1000 —
// exhausting the window mid-run and failing ~25 specs with a misleading
// "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'token')" rather than an obvious 429.
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 100 : 20000,
  message: {
    status: 'error',
    message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again after 15 minutes.'
  },
  standardHeaders: true,
  legacyHeaders: false
});
app.use('/api/', limiter);

// A second, much tighter bucket for the credential endpoints.
//
// The limiter above is one shared allowance across all 84 routes, so in production a single
// attacker gets 100 login attempts per window *and* consumes the clinic's own budget doing it —
// and in every other environment 20,000, which is no limit at all for password guessing. There is
// also no failed-login counter or account lockout anywhere in the schema, so nothing else slows
// credential stuffing down.
//
// skipSuccessfulRequests is the important flag: it means normal staff signing in all morning
// never touch this, while an attacker guessing wrong accumulates against it immediately. Keyed by
// IP, which a distributed attack still evades — this raises the cost, it does not remove the need
// for lockout, which needs a schema change and is tracked separately.
//
// Left generous outside production for the same reason as the limiter above: the Playwright suite
// signs in repeatedly, and tripping this mid-run produces scattered failures that look like
// anything but a rate limit.
const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 10 : 2000,
