/**
 * The clinic's own identity, served at runtime.
 *
 * These values already existed on the frontend as build-time `VITE_CLINIC_*` constants, and that
 * was the wrong mechanism for who has to set them. Vite inlines `import.meta.env` when the bundle
 * is built, so entering the clinic's TIN meant editing `frontend/.env` and running `npm run
 * build` — which is not something a clinic administrator will ever do, and is why the field was
 * still empty months after it was added. The receipt consequently kept printing "not a
 * BIR-registered Official Receipt" with no practical route to changing that.
 *
 * Reading them here instead makes it a backend `.env` edit and a restart: the same operation as
 * changing the SMTP password, which somebody does actually perform.
 *
 * Public and unauthenticated on purpose. Every field is already printed on the public website's
 * footer, on the services page and on any receipt handed across the counter — a TIN and a
 * business permit are published identifiers, not secrets. Gating them would only mean the login
 * page could not render the clinic's own address.
 *
 * Anything unset is returned as an empty string rather than omitted, so the frontend's merge is a
 * plain "use this if it is non-empty" and never has to distinguish absent from blank.
